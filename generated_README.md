## Usage

When it comes time to create a README for your project, run this program to ensure you have included all of the standard sections within the README file. For each question presented within the application, either provide a typed answer, or select from a list of options before hitting 'return' to move to the next question. Once all questions have been answered, a file called 'generated_README' will be written to the root folder of this application. The file can be renamed and moved as needed.
